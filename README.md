# OTOBO Agent Skin Template
This project contains a minimal example to generate [OTOBO](https://github.com/RotherOSS/otobo) agent skin template.

## Structure of project 
The current project contains three component which are required to build a valid agent skin template.

### Configuration File
The configuration file `./Kernel/Config/Files/XML/ExampleAgentSkin.xml` contains all meta data which are required by OTOBO to determine the 
type of the plugin. 

### Data files 
The data files `./var/httpd/htdocs/skins/Agent/ExampleAgentSkin/*` are loaded if the agent enables the skin in the user settings. 
It is not required to copy the complete `default` skin, as the `default` skin is always loaded. 

### SOPM / Package spec file
The sopm file contains all meta data and a file list. 
(More complex packages may also contain database options and additional installation steps.)

## Building OPM package
To build the OPM package a SOPM file is required. 

The OPM package is generated by the GitHub Workflows if a valid tag is supplied. (eg. `v1.0.0`, `v1.2.3`).

A new tag can be generated by using `git tag` and `git push origin`

```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```
